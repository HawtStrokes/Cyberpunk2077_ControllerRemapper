As of patch 1.6, there is virtually no concrete way to change the button layouts for controllers in the game. This tool allows the remapping of controller buttons to actions with a few extra:

1.  Button combos support
2.  Single Tap or Double Tap Mode
3.  Hold or Toggle Mode

It also provides persistence capability, allowing you to store button layouts on disk, so you can have multiple button layout presets you can pick and load. Resetting defaults is also possible.

## **How It Works**

It takes the currently configured binds and builds minimized XML files associated with Input Mappings, which will replace the ones in the game folder.
