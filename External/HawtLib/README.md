# **HawtLib**
A collection of C++ Libraries

## **Getting Started**

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/HawtStrokes/HawtLib`.

~~In a command line (terminal), run premake5 (a Windows binary executable is provided in the External folder) with the appropriate 'action' parameter—vs2017, vs2019, etc.~~
~~`External/premake/premake5.exe [action]`~~
~~This should generate the necessary project files.~~
